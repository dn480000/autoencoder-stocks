[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dn480000/autoencoder-stocks/master)

The notebook demonstrates the advantage of autoencoder over PCA in learning a holistic low-dimensional representation of assets based on their returns. 

The autoencoder is implemented with [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
